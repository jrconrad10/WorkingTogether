# WorkingTogether
This program was worked on by Jacob Conrad and Jack Handy.
This program is supposed to model a vending machine with 5 different snacks that a user can order one by one. They can get money back if they add too much money for the snack and there is also a confirmation feature to make sure the user wants to make the purchase.
